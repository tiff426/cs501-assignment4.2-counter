## Assignment 4.2
This application is a reactive counter called Counter++ that has buttons to allow users to increment or decrement the count, and also a button to reset the count. If enabled, the counter also auto-increments every 3 seconds using a coroutine. This setting can be configured on a separate screen that is reachable through a button. The counter state is managed with ViewModel, it uses StateFlow, and also displays the count and status of the auto-incrementation.
